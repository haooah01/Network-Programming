# udpclientserverapp

This directory contains UDP client/server example applications and related resources for the Network-Programming repo.

Add your UDP client and server implementations here (Python, C, Java, etc.). Include README notes and usage examples for each implementation.

Example structure:
- udpclientserverapp/README.md  (this file)
- udpclientserverapp/.gitkeep   (empty file to ensure folder is tracked)
- udpclientserverapp/python/udp_server.py
- udpclientserverapp/python/udp_client.py

How to contribute: Create a subdirectory for the language (e.g., "python"), add your implementation files, and update this README with run instructions.
